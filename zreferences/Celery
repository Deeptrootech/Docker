(1) WHAT IS CELERY ?
- Celery is an open-source, distributed task queue system for Python.
- which that enables the execution of asynchronous tasks for Python.

Key Components of Celery:
- Client:
   => The part of your application that sends tasks to the message broker.
- Message Broker:
   => An intermediary that queues up tasks. Common choices include RabbitMQ and Redis.
- Worker:
   => Dedicated processes that constantly monitor the message broker for new tasks and execute them.
- Result Backend (Optional):
   => Used to store and retrieve the results of executed tasks.

How Celery Works:
- A client application initiates a task and sends it to the message broker.
- The message broker queues the task, making it available for processing.
- Celery workers, running in the background, pick up tasks from the queue.
- The workers execute the tasks asynchronously, meaning the main application can continue processing other requests without waiting for the task to complete.
- If a result backend is configured, the worker can store the task's result for later retrieval by the client.
