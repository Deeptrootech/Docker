ðŸ”¹ ********** Workflow of `docker compose up` **********

step-1. **Read `docker-compose.yml`**
   - Finds services, ports, volumes, environment variables, etc.

step-2. **Check images for each service**
   - If `build:` â†’ builds image from Dockerfile **only if needed** (new or changed, or forced with `--build`).
   - If `image:` â†’ look for local image.
     - If not found â†’ pull from registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

step-3. **Create network(s)**
   - Docker Compose makes a default network so services can talk to each other by name.

step-4. **Create volumes (if defined)**
   - For data persistence (e.g., Postgres, Redis data).

step-5. **Start containers**
   - Each service container starts with its `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT` from the image.

step-6. **Orchestration**
   - Services run together, connected via the network.
   - Logs from all containers stream to your terminal.
